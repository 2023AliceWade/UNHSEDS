# UNH SEDS

This is the official GitHub for UNH Students for the Exploration and Development of Space. 

Every September and February, UNH SEDS will train members on the software needed to use this. 
This GitHub is purely used for versioning engineering files at the moment, although an archive
of previous years' files is kept for posterity.

Please contact Mason McDonald at mason.mcdonald@unh.edu to join! 

Let's get to work,

Mason McDonald

*President, UNH SEDS*
