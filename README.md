# UNHSEDS

This is the official GitHub for UNH Students for the Exploration and Development of Space. 

Every September and February, UNH SEDS will train members on the software needed to use this. 
Because of GitHub's limitation, we are keeping large files like videos, pictures and other large PDF's 
on Google Drive that can be shared to you. 

Please contact Alice Wade at 2023awade@gmail.com to join! 

Let's get to work,

Alice Wade,

President
